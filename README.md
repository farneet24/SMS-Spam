## Overview

SMS/Email Spam Detector is a machine learning-powered solution designed to accurately filter and classify spam in text messages and emails. Utilizing cutting-edge text preprocessing techniques and a selection of machine learning classifiers, the system ensures high reliability in distinguishing spam from legitimate ("ham") content.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The foundational programming language for the project.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Used for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Bernoulli Naive Bayes, ExtraTreesClassifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) among others.

## Functionalities

### Text Preprocessing
- Utilizes NLTK for robust text cleansing and feature engineering.

### Algorithm Evaluation
- Assesses a range of machine learning classifiers to identify the most effective algorithms for spam detection.

### Ensemble Methods
- Employs ensemble techniques, such as Voting and Stacking Classifiers, to maximize model performance.

## Model Metrics

The implemented ensemble methods yield a staggering accuracy rate of 98%, showcasing the reliability of the model.
