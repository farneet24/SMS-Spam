## Introduction
This project focuses on the detection of spam in SMS and emails using machine learning algorithms. It employs advanced text preprocessing techniques and classifier algorithms to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Various Machine Learning Algorithms including Bernoulli Naive Bayes, ExtraTreesClassifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction using NLTK.
- Evaluation of multiple machine learning algorithms to identify top-performing classifiers.
- Implementation of ensemble methods for improved accuracy.

## Model Performance
The model achieves a high accuracy rate of 98% by employing ensemble methods like Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier to combine the strengths of individual algorithms.

## Live Demo
The project is hosted on Streamlit Server. You can check out the live demo [here](https://farneet24-sms-spam-app-r53bi4.streamlit.app/).
